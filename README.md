# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors project from The Odin Project: Foundations

This is my first project putting together everything I have learned in javascript foundations so far. Completing the first iteration of this program will demonstrate my understanding of basic coding logic, js syntax, functions, and variables.

A later iteration will apply a GUI to the program.
